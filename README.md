This repository presents the Penalty-Based Guardrail Algorithm (PGA) for efficiently solving large-scale, nonlinear, and nonconvex constrained minimization problems with increasing objective function and nondecreasing inequality constraints. Many real-world decision problems in fields like control systems, engineering, and optimization can be modeled as such problems. PGA adapts the traditional penalty-based algorithm by introducing a dynamic guardrail variable that adjusts the constraints iteratively, based on historical constraint values. This helps balance constraint violations and the minimization of the objective function. In this repository, we compare PGA with four well-known first-order algorithms and the baseline mathematical programming solver on three linear evaluation domains, three nonlinear evaluation domains, and real-world control of a district heating system domain.
